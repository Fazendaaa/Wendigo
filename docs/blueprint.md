Welcome to Fazendaaa's {{ pkg.name }}. This is version {{ pkg.version }}!

Made with:

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Ideia

Currently, in the company that I work for we have a CLI (Command Line Interface) made in [Python](https://www.python.org/) called `estat` that you can read more about it right [here](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Succubus). But one of its features is porting Docker-based projects to other plataforms just like:

- Kubernetes (K8s): through HELM charts
- VM
- Bare metal: throufh ISOs
- etc.

As `estat` have grown so much and making it available as FOSS (Free and open-source software) was always the idea but the project still in development and not having a properly defined scope, I decided to break its main features in other projects:

- [Succubus](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Succubus): universal package manager based on cloud-native
- [Jinn](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Jinn): universal project manager built to expand Succubus capabilities
- [Baba Yaga](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/BabaYaga): universal cloud-native manager built to expand Jinn and Succubus capabilities
- [Wendigo](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Wendigo): universal project translator from cloud-native projects to other infra technologies
- [Shōjō](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/): LaTex package manager
- [Hellhound](github.com/Fazendaaa/Hellhound): VSCode extension to integrate Jinn recipes

## Components

### port

```shell
wend port
```

## Installing

You don't need to install Go to run this tool, just Docker. And to do so to give it a try, you can do it just by running the following line in your terminal:

```shell
alias wend='docker run -it --volume $(pwd):/project --workdir /project fazenda/wendigo'
```

And then running the following to check whether or not is working properly:

```shell
wend --help
```

## Running

## Author

Only [me](https://github.com/Fazendaaa) because the aforementioned project was implemented by yours only. By knowing each line of that code wrote doing the port would be more easily done this way.
